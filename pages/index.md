# GitHubWebhooks
Laravel Package that listens to GitHub webhook events and responds by creating Statuses in GitHub

## Installation
Install Package via Composer
```bash
composer require mecodeninja/githubwebhooks:^1.0
```

Publish the Package Config
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="MeCodeNinja\GitHubWebhooks\GitHubWebhooksServiceProvider"
```

Configure the Checks to be performed on your repository by editing `%storage%/app/githubwebhooks-config.yaml`
```bash
nano storage/app/githubwebhooks-config.yaml
```

Set `name` to your github repository
```yaml
repositories:
  -
    name: willwright/githubwebhooks
    token: %mytoken%
    checks:
      BranchCheck:
        branches: [origin/develop]
      PathCheck:
        paths: [/^vendor\//]
```
The `name` of the repository must match the `repo.full_name` in the payload sent by the GitHub Webhook in order to activate the Check(s). 

Set `token` to a Personal access token which was generated by you in GitHub. See: https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line
Token needs:
repo (If your Repository is Private)
repo > public_repo (If your Repository is Public)

>**Warning**
>
>Do **not** commit `githubwebhooks-config.yaml` to your SVN.  It contains sensative information
